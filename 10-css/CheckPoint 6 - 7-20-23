//STILL NEED TO DO:


//2. What technologies are most websites composed of?

//Most websites are composed of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

//3. Write the outline for an html page that connects both the CSS and js pages

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="checkpoint.css">
    <title>ID Card</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
<script src='checkpoint.js' defer></script>
</html>

//4. Describe a parent vs a child element

HTML runs in a hierachical structure.  The "parent" element contains other elements within it that are referred to as "child" elements.  For example, in question 3, a parent element is 'html,' while it children are 'head,''body,' and 'script.'

//5.  Describe event bubbling.

Event bubbling refers to how DOM and Javascript handles the flow of HTML elements.  By default, when an event occurs, the event is triggered on that element and works its way up from the innermost element (children) to the outermost element (parent).


//6.  Using div tags and CSS, make a solid red circle inside of a green square

HTML: 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="checkpoint.css">
    <title>ID Card</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="square">
        <div class="circle"></div>
    </div>
</body>
<script src='script.js' defer></script>
</html>


CSS:

.square {
height: 500px;
width: 500px;
background-color: green;

}
.circle {
display: block;
background-color: red;
height: 300px;
width: 300px;
border-radius: 200px;
}




//7. Write a paragraph and use flexbox to center it


HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="checkpoint.css">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="pcontainer">
    <p>The vibrant city buzzed with energy as people filled the streets, going about their daily routines. Cars honked their horns amidst the chaotic traffic, while pedestrians hurriedly navigated the crowded sidewalks. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the corner caf√©, enticing passersby with its rich scent. Meanwhile, the distant sound of a street performer's guitar added a melodic touch to the urban symphony. Towering skyscrapers adorned the skyline, reflecting the sunlight and casting shadows on the bustling city below. Shop windows showcased a myriad of products, enticing shoppers with their colorful displays. Laughter and conversation spilled out from open-air restaurants, where patrons savored delicious meals and shared moments of joy. Amidst the hustle and bustle, street vendors sold their wares, offering tantalizing street food and unique handcrafted items. The city's diversity was evident in its multicultural neighborhoods, each with its own distinct charm and character. From the historic landmarks to the hidden alleyways, every corner held a story waiting to be discovered. As day turned into night, the city transformed, with neon lights illuminating the streets and casting an enchanting glow. The energy of the city never waned, as it continued to thrive with life, constantly evolving and embracing the ever-changing world around it.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- <div class="square">
        <div class="circle"></div>
    </div> -->
</body>
</html> 

CSS:

.pcontainer{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    text-align: center;
    height: 100vh;
    position: absolute;
}





//8. What is an anchor tag and why do we use them?

Anchor tags create links to other websites or different parts of a webpage. We use them to access other websites, or specific sections of a webpage.

//9. What is the difference between an id and a class and when would you use which?

Id and classes are attributes that identify specific elements in HTML.  Creating an id is great for assigning a unique name to a value, while class can specify one or more class names for an element.
  I'd use id if there is an element that requires unique styling.  I'd use class when I wouldn't mind applying similar styling to multiple elements.


//10. Create both an id and a class and then access them in CSS

For an id:
<img id="littleboat" src="littleboat.jpg" alt="littleboat">
To acccess in CSS: #littleboat

For a class:
<img class="littleduck" src="littleduck.jpg" alt="littleduck">
To access in CSS: .littleduck

//11. Give an example of a block element and an inline element?

An example of a block element is div, which can be used to create a box whose dimensions (e.g. height, width) can be modified.  They start on a new line.
An example of an inline element is button, which appears inline with text of other elements.
