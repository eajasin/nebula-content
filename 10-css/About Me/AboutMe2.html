                <h2 id="AboutMe"> About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm Elizabeth, and I love to bake. Whenever I step into the kitchen, a wave of happiness and excitement rushes over me. Mixing all the ingredients together feels like creating pure magic.
                        I take so much pride in decorating my treats. Each cupcake or cake becomes a little masterpiece with beautiful designs that make everyone's mouth water. Seeing the big smiles on my family and friends' faces when they taste my baking fills my heart with warmth and joy.
                        Baking has taught me some important lessons, like being patient and careful. I know that following the recipe exactly and measuring everything just right is super important. Even if things don't turn out perfect, I keep trying and learning.
                        One day, I dream of having my very own bakery.</p>

                <h2 id="Favorites">Favorite Things to Bake</h2>
                <p> Some of my favorite things to bake are chocolate cakes, cheesecakes, and cherry rolls. My chocolate cakes are moist and rich, adorned with a luscious chocolate ganache. Cheesecakes hold a special place in my heart, as she perfects the balance of tanginess and sweetness in each velvety bite. Lastly, I adore the process of creating soft, 
                    cherry-filled rolls, glazed to perfection. With meticulous care, she crafts these treats to bring joy and satisfaction to anyone fortunate enough to indulge. The aroma of freshly baked goods fills my kitchen, and my passion shines through in every slice of cake, every creamy cheesecake, and every bite of cherry-filled delight. Sarah's 
                    creations are a testament to my baking prowess and my unwavering love for sharing the sweetness of life through my culinary creations.</p>

                <p id="goal">My goal is to become an incredible cake decorator. I love making cakes look amazing with fancy designs!
                    I want to learn different cake decorating techniques, like piping beautiful patterns and using smooth fondant. I also want to experiment with new flavors and colors to make cakes that taste delicious and look stunning.
                    In the future, I hope to teach others how to decorate cakes too. It would be so much fun to have baking parties and share my skills with friends. I also dream of entering cake decorating contests and showcasing my creations.
                    I can't wait to keep learning and creating beautiful, tasty items like these below!</p>
