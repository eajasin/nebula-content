//Gigapet inspired!
//I am creating Pet RPG in which person has to feed, play with, and groom pets; person also has to purchase food, toys, groom tools, and a new pet.
// Person earns coins for each interaction with the pets.  Each pet starts with varying levels. 
// Each property of pet 10 drops every x amount of seconds, and person gets a warning when value reaches 50.
//Upon caring for pet, the seconds interval begins again.  If any fall to 0, it's Game Over.
//At the pet store, there are two different types of all items, each with their own prices and value added to pet when used.
