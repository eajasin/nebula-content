// 1.   Declare a for loop that starts at 0, goes until 20, and increments by 1
//      Each loop it should log to the console the current index

      
        
// 2.   Declare a for loop that starts at 1, goes until 40, and increments by 2
//      Each loop it should log to the console the current index

  


// 3.   Create an array with all student names in it. 
//      Loop over the array and log each student's name to the console.
//      Inside the array declare an un-required, but useful variable for 'currentStudent' //

     
        

// 4.   Use the array below for the following question
//      Loop over the numArray & ONLY log even numbers to the console.
//      2 Hints: there will be an IF statement within the loop & be sure to check the value, not the index (dont do this (i%2 ===0))
       
        

// 5.   Use the above numArray array for this question
//      Create a for loop which will iterate over each element of the above numArray and output a new array of only odd numbers
       



// 6.   Using the nums and the two empty placeholder arrays below
//      Create a for loop which will fill the two separate arrays, one with only positive numbers, one with only negative numbers
