// 1. Declare three variables and assign them each a numeric value. Multiply the first two numbers, add the third number, and log the result to the console.


// 2. Create a variable and assign it a numeric value. Subtract 5 from the number, multiply the result by 10, and log the final value to the console.


// 3. Declare two variables and assign them each a numeric value. Divide the first number by the second number, round the result to the nearest hundredth, and log the final value to the console.


// 4. Create a variable and assign it a numeric value. Multiply the number by 3, subtract 7, and then raise the result to the power of 2. Log the final value to the console.


// 5. Declare two variables and assign them each a numeric value. Find the average of the two numbers, then multiply the result by 4, and finally add 7. Log the final value to the console.


// 6. Create a variable and assign it a numeric value. Subtract 3 from the number, then find the square root of the result, and finally multiply by 8. Log the final value to the console.


// 7. Declare two variables and assign them each a numeric value. Subtract the second number from the first number, then find the absolute value of the result, and finally multiply by 2. Log the final value to the console.


// 8. Create a variable and assign it a numeric value. Multiply the number by 2, then find the square root of the result, and finally subtract 4. Log the final value to the console.


// 9. Declare two variables and assign them each a numeric value. Find the difference between the first number and the second number, then divide the result by 2, and finally add 10. Log the final value to the console.


// 10. Create a variable and assign it a numeric value. Divide the number by 2, then find the cube of the result, and finally subtract 3. Log the final value to the console.
