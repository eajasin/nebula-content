//NEED HELP WITH 11



//1. Which cohort are you in?

    //SV11

//2. What is a function and why is it useful?

    //Function are reusable chunks of code, and they are useful because they can be reused in mulitple parts of a program and combined to create a larger, modular structure.

//3. Explain a parameter and an argument.

    //Parameters are placeholders for an input that can be passed into a function when it is executed.  Arguments are the actual input that will pass through the function during invocation.


//4. Write a function declaration, a function expression, and an arrow function.

    //A) Function Declaration: 

    //     function japaneseGreeting(){
    //         console.log("konnichiwa")
    //     }

    // //B) Function Expression:

    //     const japaneseGreeting(){
    //         console.log("konnichiwa")
    //     }

    // //C) Arrow Function:

    //     const japaneseGreeting = () => {
    //         console.log("konnichiwa")
    //     }

//5. What is a higher order function and why do we use them?

    //High-order functions are functions that can take on another function as an argument.  Because they can return other functions, they can make coding manageable and concise.


//6. Declare an object that a school system may use to present a student?

    // const student = {
    //         grade: 3,
    //         age: 9,
    //         readingLevel: "Above Average",
    //         emergencyContactOnFile: true,
    //         allergies: "peanuts"
    // }

    // console.log(student)

//7. What is a property and what is a method in relation to objects?

    //A property is a key-value pair that describes an object.  A method is a function that the object can invoke on itself.

//8. Describe a key-value pair?

    //Key-value pairs describe an object.  Objects use keys, instead of indices, to hold and access its values.

//9. Create an object with at least 5 key pairs and then access 3 of those keys.

    const rainbow = {
        color1: "red",
        color2: "orange",
        color3: "yellow",
        color4: "green",
        color5: "blue",
        color6: "indigo",
        color7: "violet"
    };

// console.log(rainbow.color1)
// console.log(rainbow["color2"])
// console.log(rainbow.color3)

//10. Create a method using your object.

// function skittles(rainbow){
//     return "Skittles, taste the rainbow!"
// }
// console.log(skittles(rainbow))
// console.log(Object.keys(rainbow))

//11. Create a function that allows you to add new properties to your object. 

function addNewProperties (obj, newKey, newValue) {
   return obj.newKey = newValue 
}

console.log(addNewProperties(rainbow, color8, "pink"))
